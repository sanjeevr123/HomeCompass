# HomeCompass — HDB Downsizing Helper

[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Course**: DSE3101 | **AY2025/2026** | **Group**: flatfinders

## Overview
HomeCompass is a senior-friendly web application designed to help elderly Singaporean HDB homeowners (aged 65 and above) make informed and confident housing downsizing decisions. The system integrates three core components into a guided five-step interface:

- Resale Price Estimator — predicts the current market value of the user's existing flat using an XGBoost model trained on ~250,000 historical HDB resale transactions from 2015 to 2026 
- Senior Accessibility Index (SAI) Scoring — ranks available listings by proximity to and density of senior-critical amenities (MRT stations, hawker centres, parks, clinics, and community clubs), weighted by the user's lifestyle preferences
- Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) Calculator — estimates LBS proceeds to give users a complete financial picture of their downsizing options

You can access the deployed app **[HomeCompass here](https://homecompass-app.onrender.com)**. Please open the **[Backend](https://homecompass-backend-8g2f.onrender.com)** link first and wait for it to load before launching the app as it is hosted on Render free tier and may take 1–2 minutes to wake up.

## Model

### Algorithm
The price prediction model is an XGBoost regressor trained on ~250,000 HDB resale transactions spanning 2015 to 2026.

### Target Variable
Rather than predicting raw resale price, the model predicts a normalised log price:
```text
log_price_norm = log(resale_price / (floor_area_sqm × RPI_annual))
```
Dividing by floor_area_sqm converts the target to a per-square-metre basis, removing the mechanical size-price relationship. Dividing by the annual average RPI removes the macro market trend, so the model learns only the structural and locational value of each flat. At inference, predictions are inverted back to SGD:
```text
estimated_price = exp(log_price_norm_pred) × floor_area_sqm × CURRENT_RPI
```
The live RPI is fetched from the data.gov.sg API at server startup, ensuring predictions are always anchored to the prevailing market level without requiring model retraining.

### Preprocessing
- **Deduplication** — duplicate rows removed via DataFrame.drop_duplicates()
- **RPI merging** — quarterly RPI data converted from wide to long format, averaged annually, and merged onto each transaction row by sold_year
- **Categorical encoding** — town, flat_type, storey_category, and region label-encoded using sklearn LabelEncoder; encoders are persisted in the model artifacts to ensure consistent mappings at inference
- **Feature exclusions** — identifiers, raw coordinates, lease derivations, and any columns derived from resale_price (e.g. town_median_price) were excluded to prevent data leakage
- **Geospatial features** — distances to and counts of nearby amenities (MRT, hawker centres, parks, clinics, community clubs) were pre-computed by geocoding each flat's address via OneMap and calculating distances against Singapore's public amenity datasets
- **Sample weights** — transactions are assigned linearly increasing weights by recency, ranging from 1.0 (oldest year) to 2.0 (most recent training year), reflecting that recent market conditions are more representative of current pricing

## Key Features (Ranked by Importance)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `is_mature_estate` | Consistent price premium for mature estates |
| `max_floor_lvl` | Maximum floor level of the block |
| `region` | Regional location grouping |
| `remaining_lease` | Non-linear lease decay effect; CPF restrictions apply below ~70 years |
| `storey_category` | Floor level — Low / Mid / High |
| `nearest_mrt_distance_m` | Within-town MRT proximity; not fully captured by town alone |
| `num_amenities_within_1000m` | Total amenities within 1km radius |
| `flat_type` | Size and layout category |

---

## Cross-Validation Strategy
A time-based train/test split was used rather than random k-fold cross-validation:

```text
Training set: All transactions with sold_year < 2023
Test set: All transactions with sold_year ≥ 2023
```

This mirrors real-world deployment conditions where the model is trained on historical data and evaluated on future unseen transactions. Random k-fold splitting would allow future transactions to leak into the training set, producing inflated evaluation metrics that would not reflect actual out-of-sample performance. Early stopping (50 rounds) was applied during training using the held-out test set as the evaluation set, automatically selecting the best iteration and preventing overfitting.

---

## Model Performance

| Evaluation Set | RMSE | MAPE |
|----------------|-----|------|
| Internal test set (2023+ transactions) | $43,872 | ~4.78% |

---

## SAI Score
The Senior Accessibility Index (SAI) is computed for each PropertyGuru listing using the distances to and counts of nearby senior-critical amenities: MRT stations, hawker centres, parks, clinics, and community clubs. Each amenity dimension is weighted by the user's stated lifestyle preferences, supplied via sliders in the frontend. Listings are ranked by their weighted SAI score, ensuring recommendations are tailored to each individual user's accessibility priorities rather than a one-size-fits-all ranking.

---

## Application Interface

The frontend is structured as a **five-step wizard** designed specifically for senior users, following established UX principles to minimise cognitive load and decision fatigue.

### Five-Step Wizard

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | Enter current flat details — postal code, flat type, floor area, remaining lease |
| **Step 2** | View estimated selling price with ±10% confidence interval and town median benchmark |
| **Step 3** | Set downsizing preferences — maximum budget, flat type, preferred towns |
| **Step 4** | Review LBS financial estimate; set amenity priority weights |
| **Step 5** | View top 3 listing recommendations with SAI scores, cash unlocked estimates, interactive map, flat comparison modal, and direct PropertyGuru links |

Each recommendation card displays the listed price, estimated cash unlocked from downsizing, distance from the user's current flat, and nearby amenities within 1km. An interactive Leaflet map overlays the user's current flat, recommended flats, and surrounding amenities, with layer toggling to reduce visual clutter. A comparison modal allows users to assess trade-offs across all three recommendations side-by-side.

---

    "address_from_url": "228 SIMEI STREET 4 SINGAPORE 520228",
    "predicted_price": 520000,
    "valuation_label": "Above Market"
  }
]
```

---

## Known Limitations
- **Listing freshness** — the PropertyGuru listing pool is a scraped snapshot and is not updated in real time; listings may have been taken down or repriced since scraping
- **User-facing prediction** — geospatial features (MRT distance, amenity counts) are imputed from town-level medians when a specific block address is not provided; the ±10% confidence band reflects this uncertainty
- **Listing premiums** — per-town and per-flat-type multipliers used to bridge transacted and asking prices were calibrated from a single listing snapshot and should be recalibrated periodically
- **English only** — the interface does not currently support other languages, limiting accessibility for seniors more comfortable in Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil
- **Mobile responsiveness** — the layout has not been fully optimised for small-screen devices; seniors accessing via tablet or phone may encounter display issues
